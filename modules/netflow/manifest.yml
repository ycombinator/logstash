short_description: Ingest and analysze NetFlow network traffic data
long_description: |
  NetFlow is a feature that was introduced on Cisco routers that provides the ability to collect IP network traffic as it enters or exits an interface. By analyzing the data provided by NetFlow, a network administrator can determine things such as the source and destination of traffic, class of service, and the causes of congestion.

  To analyze NetFlow data with the Elastic stack, run a Logstash instance as a NetFlow Collector and start sending NetFlow data to it on the designated UDP port. Then visit Kibana to analyze your NetFlow data using dashboards such as the ones shown here.
